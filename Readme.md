# My Flask Web Application

This is a simple web application built using **Flask**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and (optionally) **JavaScript**. The application allows users to input their name and age, processes this data on the back end, and displays the result.

## Features
- Input form for user's name and age.
- Data validation (ensures both fields are filled and age is a number).
- Result page that displays the submitted information.
- Basic error handling and user feedback through flashing messages.

## Project Structure
- `app.py`: The main Flask application.
- `templates/`: Folder containing HTML templates (`index.html` for the form, `result.html` for the results).
- `static/`: Folder containing static files (e.g., CSS styles).
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies for the project.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## Requirements
To run this application, you need the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.12.6
- Flask
